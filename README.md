# SELF-INITATED-PROJECT-C++
Secure Diary Manager

A personal diary management system with a focus on security and simplicity.

About the Project

The Secure Diary Manager is a C++ program designed to help users store and manage their personal diary entries securely. With a menu-driven interface, users can easily add, view, and search their diary entries. The program uses a simple encryption technique to protect user data.

Key Features

- Secure Diary Entries: Diary entries are encrypted using a Caesar cipher to protect user data.
- Menu-Driven Interface: Easy-to-use menu for adding, viewing, and searching diary entries.
- Master Password Protection: Access to the diary is protected by a master password.

Getting Started

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the program and enter the master password (1234 by default).
3. Use the menu to add, view, or search diary entries.

Security Considerations

While the Caesar cipher used in this program provides a basic level of encryption, it may not be suitable for protecting sensitive information. For more robust security, consider using a stronger encryption algorithm.

Future Development

Some potential areas for future development include:

- Implementing a more secure encryption algorithm
- Adding additional features, such as password hashing and salting
- Improving the user interface and experience
